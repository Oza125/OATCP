DICE COMBINATION 
The given C++ code exemplifies a robust implementation of a dynamic programming algorithm aimed at efficiently computing the number of ways to climb a staircase. Employing a bottom-up approach, the algorithm iteratively calculates the number of ways for each step count and stores the results in a vector named dp. To address the challenge of handling large intermediate results, the code utilizes modular arithmetic with a modulo value of 1e9 + 7. The solve function encapsulates input/output operations for each test case, printing the computed number of ways to ascend the staircase. This implementation showcases a well-designed and effective dynamic programming strategy for tackling staircase climbing problems.


GRID PATH

The provided C++ code adeptly addresses a grid path problem by leveraging a dynamic programming approach. It leverages a two-dimensional vector named dp to store cumulative path counts, skillfully initializing base cases and iteratively computing valid paths by aggregating those from the top and left cells. Upon completion, the final result, indicative of the number of unique paths, is displayed, effectively showcasing the application of dynamic programming to maneuver through obstacles and ascertain optimal paths within the grid.
